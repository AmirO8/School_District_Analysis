# School_District_Analysis

# Purpose
This district analysis was done to acquire the correct reading and math scores from Thomas High School. The 9th grade students are not included in this analysis as their test scores were altered. We compare several variables, school type, total students at each school and the budget per each student.

# Results
- The School District analysis stays the same

# Summary
After 9th grade students at Thomas High School were replaced with Nan, passing math percentage, passing reading percentage and overall passing score increased significantly. Thomas High School is now the second best performing high school behind Cabrera High School. Since Charter schools performed better on average than regular school it could be that due to the Charter school system they get the better quality students because Charter schools cater to students unique abilities. It could also be that Charter Schools set high standrads. 

If I were a district board member I would be very concerned because the best performing school was a Charter and they performed almost 40 points better than the lowest performing school. The first factor I would look at is the size of the classes District schools on average have more students than Charter school. Could it be that class sizes are too big for students to get a sufficent education. The budget per student were very similar, could it be that Charter schools make the most of the money they have and District schools do not know how to manage their budget.
